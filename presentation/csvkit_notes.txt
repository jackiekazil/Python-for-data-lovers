"csvkit is comprised of a number of individual command line utilities that be loosely divided into a few major categories: Input, Processing, and Output"

Grab the first 5 lines to take a peek.
Using Unix text-processing utility head :
$ head -n 5 data/pass_2011_CSV.csv

Rinse & Repeat to make sure all the files don't appear to have issues.
* Fast Forward *
They don't. So, let's move on.

Let's compare the head of each of the files to make sure they are the same using csvcut.
csvcut:
"Filter and truncate CSV files. Like unix "cut" command, but for tabular data."

$ csvcut -n pass_2011_CSV.csv
1: PO_NUMBER
2: AGENCY_NAME
3: NIGP_DESCRIPTION
4: PO_TOTAL_AMOUNT
5: ORDER_DATE
6: SUPPLIER
7: SUPPLIER_FULL_ADDRESS
8: SUPPLIER_CITY
9: SUPPLIER_STATE

* Fast Foward *
They are the same.
Although, we are lucky in this case, you should never truth your data.
Never. Ever. Trust your data.

For the purpose of our social network analysis, since there are not millions of records,
it is easier for the files to all be in one file.
Let's use csvstack.

csvstack:
"Stack up the rows from multiple CSV files, optionally adding a grouping value."

$ csvstack original/*.csv > pass_2004_to_2011.csv
*NOTE* If one of your headers doesn't match, it will still combine the file without throwing an error.

Let's create a sample file to test against to cut down wait time.
$ head -n 1000 original/pass_2011_CSV.csv > pass_2011_sample.csv
