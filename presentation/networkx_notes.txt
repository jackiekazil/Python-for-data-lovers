Networkx can be a pain to install, because of requirements.
'pip install networkx' does not work.

It is best to visit pypi and choose the one that is right you.
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/networkx

Here is some more information on installing NetworkX
http://networkx.lanl.gov/install.html

$ pip install numpy
# numpy must be installed before matplotlib is installed
$ pip install matplotlib
$ pip install http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/n/networkx/networkx-1.6.tar.gz#md5=a5e62b841b30118574b57d0eaf1917ca


When working with a larger dataset, it is best to create a sample set to test code against.
When you are ready, run against a larger set.
Why?
Otherwise you will never finish.
Even if you think a dataset is "small," it probably isn't.

# TODO: Insert info on # of links & data points
# How your small dataset becomes big very quickly.

To mitigate keeping things in memory and rerunning processes, we write some mid-step output files
Why?
Otherwise you will never finish.

First we create edgelist output that we will run analysis against:
python create_edgelist.py ../../data/original/pass_2011_CSV.csv AGENCY_NAME SUPPLIER output/agency_supplier_2011.csv

output file looks like this:
PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION,DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES,2
PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION,COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,2
DC PUBLIC LIBRARY,OFFICE ON AGING,2
DC PUBLIC LIBRARY,"DEPART OF INSURANCE,SECURITIES & BANKING",2
DC PUBLIC LIBRARY,DEPT. OF CONSUMER AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS,2
DC PUBLIC LIBRARY,OFFICE OF CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER,2
DC PUBLIC LIBRARY,DEPART OF YOUTH REHABILITATION SERVICES,4
DC PUBLIC LIBRARY,OFFICE OF PEOPLE'S COUNSEL,2


Now, we analyze the network before we visualize to get a feel for the landscape
